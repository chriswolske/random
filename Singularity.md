So today I read Elon Musk's tweet from August: 
>> Hope we're not just the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence. Unfortunately, that is increasingly probable
As I followed up: "Mind blown. perfectly good day Ruined." (or something like that)

Whether or not the Singularity is a sure-thing is a completely different conversation; for fun let's just assume that it is accurate and will happen in the next 40 years. Then it will likely happen in my (natural) lifetime, and almost certainly happen in my daughters' lifetimes.

As I am being constantly reminded (by Blundell, Wesley, and others), you can't be half-a-Christian and you can't serve two masters. Things are either "of God" ot they are "of the World". I probably need to read more about the history of Science, which almost certainly considered "of the World" and anti-religion but is now accepted as something that God reveals to us (or is good for us, anyhow).

Accepting the assumption that the Singularity is a certaintly, and the belief that it cannot be spiritually benign, determining the potential and likely spiritual consequences of the Singularity is of great importance and eternal consequence.

!!Singularity as Man attempting to be God-like
* obvious allusion to The Fall

!!Singularity as the Second Coming
* heaven on Earth?
* early Singularists will have "miraculous" powers
* uploading = ascention?
